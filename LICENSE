2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 are effective on the date
Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Contributions
available to a third party.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), no license is granted to any trademark
rights.

2.4. Revised Versions of this License

Contributor may elect to license the Contributions it makes under this
License under either the license described in Exhibit A or under the
terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Mozilla.

2.5. Representation of Authority to Contribute

Contributor represents that Contributor has sufficient copyright rights
in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this License.

2.6. Support

Contributor is not obligated to provide any support for Covered
Software, although Contributor may choose to do so. Unless otherwise
agreed to by Contributor in a separate written agreement, Contributor
shall provide Modifications on a "work for hire" basis, with no ongoing
obligation to provide support.

2.7. Patent Rights

(a) Patent Grant.
    Subject to the terms of this License, Contributor hereby grants to
    You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
    sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Software, where
    such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
    Contributor that are necessarily infringed by Contributor's
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Contributor's
    Contribution(s) with the Covered Software to which such Contribution
    was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    the Covered Software infringes Your patent(s), then any patent
    licenses granted to You under this License for the Covered Software
    shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

(b) No Additional Patent Grants.
    No patent license is granted under this License to any patent
    claims that would be necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)
    alone, but for the avoidance of doubt, any patent claim that would
    be infringed by Your Contribution(s) when combined with any
    Covered Software.

3. Distribution Obligations
---------------------------

3.1. Availability of Source Code

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
must also be made available in Source Code Form, and that Source Code
Form must be made available under the terms of this License.

3.2. Modifications

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe
Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and
the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses,
then You are permitted to distribute the Larger Work under the terms of
that Secondary License(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if You are
required to make the Modifications available under Section 3.1, then
You must also make the Modifications available under the terms of this
License.

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Covered Software,
or any notices referencing this License. You may add Your own notices
to the Covered Software, but such notices must not modify or change
this License.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by that Contributor under this License shall terminate on the date
the litigation is filed.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not apply to this License. You may receive a copy of the license
